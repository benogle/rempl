REMPL

REMPL is a script that will push a local playlist (*.m3u or *.pls) to a remote
WinAMP instance running the AjaxAMP plugin. This is useful for playlists 
specifying remote/web streams such as radio stations or playlists generated by
a satchmo or zina server.
 
Usage is simple:
 
rempl.py -s http://yourserver:5151 /path/to/playlist.pls
 
If you would like to enqueue the playlist instead of immediately playing the 
specified playlist, add the '-e' argument:
 
rempl.py -e -s http://yourserver:5151 /path/to/playlist.pls
 
Edit the DEFAULT_SERVER var in rempl.py to point to your AjaxAMP install if you
would like to omit the -s arg.
